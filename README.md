# Baseball-Swing-Coaching-Analysis
Overview

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes high-resolution baseball swing data from five batters with the goal of translating biomechanical motion data into actionable insights for hitting coaches. The analysis focuses on identifying key swing events and extracting intuitive performance metrics related to timing, power generation, and contact quality.

What This Notebook Does

Loads and cleans raw time-series swing data

Identifies three key swing events:

Ball Release

Maximum Bat Speed

End of Swing

Calculates coach-relevant metrics at each event, including:

Contact

Sweet spot hit

Stride length

Torso-pelvis rotational ratio

Outputs a consolidated table summarizing results across all batters

Why It Matters

Biomechanical swing data is often difficult to interpret outside of technical or research settings. This notebook demonstrates how a data analyst can bridge the gap between raw motion capture data and on-field coaching decisions, enabling coaches to quickly identify mechanical strengths, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement.

Tools Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

Intended Audience

Baseball operations & analytics teams

Player development and performance staff

Coaches seeking data-supported feedback without deep biomechanics expertise

Notes

Data used in this project is anonymized and structured for analytical demonstration purposes.

Metric definitions and interpretations are explained directly within the notebook for clarity.
